### Medical Calculators

Medical Calculators are AI-powered tools for generating estimated predictions of a patient's outcome based on their data. There are different kind of predictions a calculator can make:

1. **Risk Assessment Rank**: Sorted cluster based on a patient's profile to determine its group in a population. This can help us estimate a number of variables based on historical data from patients that share that same rank. For example, a rank from 1 to 10 based on the average number of days a patient in that rank will stay in the ICU after surgery.
2. **Numeric Prediction**: Estimated value based on patient's data that will provide a specific numeric answer with a certain amount of variance depending on the performance of the AI model. For example, the specific number of days for ICU stay, with a certain variance.
3. **Classification**: Binary result that estimates whether a patient's outcome will belong to a given class or not, the accuracy of the prediction will vary from model to model which are tuned to a specific requirement. For example, whether a patient will stay over a week in the ICU after surgery or not.
